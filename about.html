        Hi, My name is <b>Hannah Kang</b>! <br>
        I am an <b>Information Technology</b> major and in my last year of school! <br> 
        My career goal consists of working as a Product Manager, as I love working behind the scenes when <br>
        developing products and enjoy getting to work with cross-functional teams to garner new ideas and <br>
        perspectives. As an IT student, I am actively exploring the intersection of technology and creativity. <br>
        Having grown up with a passion for creating—whether crafting with my hands or editing videos—I appreciate <br>
        the importance of transcending mere data collection to craft impactful and compelling products that <br>
        resonate with target audiences.

        <br><br>

        Outside of work and academics, some of my hobbies/interests include digital media, video editing, <br>
        Letterboxd, graphic design, and collecting LPs.

        <br><br>

        Feel free to contact me <a href="mailto:hkang33.gmu">here</a>!
